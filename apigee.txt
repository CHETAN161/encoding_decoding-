caching: to store the frequently accesss data in temp location to reduce latency  that is reusable we use caching policy .
        Caching is the ability to store copies of frequently accessed data in several places along the request-response path.

diffrence between ouath2.0 and jwt ?
  ->ouath2.0  is framework and jwt is token 
  
jwt: we want access a client resource by 3rd part application without useing client credential for that we use a token a jwt token is a spectial type of token 
     which can carry information internally inside the token as well as we can able to validate payload it is coming from authenticated source or not we can able
     to sign payload with secrate.

    1 . when a end user want to login 3rd party application  a3 rd party application register theair self with authorization/authetication server 
        an share the client key and client secrate 
    2. client store this key and secrate and share it to authorizaton server than api call send to the rsource backend server through apigee
    3. when it is valid credential and come to authorization server apigee genrate jwt token which is a sign token with secrate key 
    4. this token send back to 3rd party application 
    5. then 3rd party application showa genrated token to apigee server apigee server verify this tokn with sign secrate it gives access to backen services .
    6. and response will send back to client 
 store the client information in cookies and store it in json format 

    jwt: compat way to securly transfer information between client api 
      it has a 3 part : 
    header:type of token,algoritham to (genrate signature : use sha256,rsa,pkcs1 padding ),
    payload : contain actual information of user 
    signature :   create a secrate by calculatiing header ,payload and create a secrate signature 

Flowhook: Flowhook is used to attach a shared flow in specific point of exicuting path in all apinproxy which is lies in the same envoirment .

      Types of flowhook:
                         1.preproxy :exicute before request go to the 
                         2.postproxy
                         3.posttarget
                         4.pretarget

servicecallout : service callout allow us to call an external service from an api proxy  it could be external or internal . 
                 it is call using flow callout policy

               http: Is used to call external service 

               proxy.chaining :Its an Mp to Mp api ,suppose we call external service and we call it ,a call is go outside of
                               the n/w and agin entre to the apidgee edge and go to the
                               service it may cause of latency for that we use proxy.chaining so api call not going outside n/w and help to reduce latency . 
 
default rule : it act as an exceptional handler for any error, that is not handle by any faultrule.if the condition for all faultrule does not 
   match it exeicuted.

faultRule:it is an customize error get executed as per the condition .

sharesflow: combination of policy and resources into sharedflow .that we can consume it from multiple proxies lies in same envoirment.

flowcallout:flowcallout is used to call a shered flow from api proxy or either another shared flow .

kvm : key value mapping where  we store and retrive the data ,kvm is an secure area for key and value pair an api proxies consume that key and value from kvm
 .in kvm key-value stored in encripted form .

  mappIdentfier kvm : to give the name of a kvm .

apikey: in apigee edge apiproduct is the way we expose the api to consumeing devlope.the only required setting for a Verify API Key policy is the 
          expected location of the API key in the client request. The API proxy will check the location that you specify, and extract the API key. 

assign message:it is used to change or create request and response msg during the api proxy flow .
                add,copy,remove,set 

ouath: ouath is used to access the client resource  by 3rd  party application without using a credentials for perticular time period we used ouath .
   
      grant types :
                        client credential :
                             client_id: a cliend is an public identifier even it is an public identifier it is not guesable by 3rd parties . 
                             client secrate:The client secret is a secret known only to the application and the authorization server.
                        authorization code 
                        implicit grant type 
                        resource owner -password grant type.

quota: To set a limit an end user request to acces the resource for perticular time frame we use quota .
       it comes under the business requirment.
       quota is basically for individual user .
       it is for a frontend 
       it control the overall uses 
      

spike arrest : spike arrest is used to avoid the sudden brust of request traffic it may cause to overwhelmed the backend service to avoid this we go for 
               spike arrest  it set up the time rule for each request .
               It commes under the technical requirment .
               spike arrest is for all user .
               it is for backend 
               it control sudden brust of traffic

Extract variable:Extract variable is used to extract the content from request and response and add variable to that content .

Message logging : it is used to keeping a record or log which is related to a request and response that flow through a api proxies 
                   it is used for debugging,monitoring and analyzing .

caching : it is used to store a frequently used data for some amount of time .

Default Route Rule: Specifies the target server for unmatched requests.

Multiple Route Rules: Allow routing to different target servers based on conditions (e.g., request path, method).

openspec:OpenSpec is an documents to create API proxies with pre-configured policies.

What is Target Servers?
a "target server" refers to API endpoint connects to the backend service or resource.
It allows defining different URLs for various environments (dev, test, production) without modifying the API code itself.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.what we ask a client to build an new  api ?
->request response packet , backend URL ,Securities,header .

2.Maximum payload Size ?
->bydefualt 10mb but we can increase it using streaming 

3.what was the next stage after building an api proxy ?
-> configure the bunch of proxy with an product and then we configure the product with app after that we prepare a documentation .
   in documentation we have request and response packet and backend URL .

4.ssl and tls ?
 ssl:server send a digital sign signature 
 Tls : tcp handshake,certificate check,key exchange and Data transmission 

->Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificates, sometimes called digital certificates, are used to establish an encrypted connection between a browser or user’s 
computer and a server or website.
 
5.connection timeout :backend not response 
6.IO timeout : connection establish but not getting response .

7.xml thread protection ?
maximum node length
maximum attribute count
maximum chield count 
maximum text length 
maximum attribute length
Limits the maximum depth
request allow to post large data or dummy data which cause memory consumtion on server and crash the server to avoid this we use xml thread protection .
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

types of api :

 web api:
 internal api 
 composite api 
 partner api :combine a multiple api in single entity 

asymmetric Encription : uses a public key for encryption and use private key for decryption
RSA-4096 bits 
DSA:digital signature algorithm -512bits   

symmetric Encryption : uses a secrate key for encryption and decryption .
AES:Advance Encryption Standard 256bits
DES:Digital Encryption Standard 56bits

Thread protectiom :
json thread protection:when someone try to send a large payload and want to crash the backend system we use json thread protection. 
ArrayElementCount,
ContainerDepth,
ObjectEntryCount,
ObjectEntryNameLength

xml thread protection :request allow to post large data or dummy data which cause memory consumtion on server and crash the server to avoid 
this we use xml thread protection .

rate limmiting :To maintain performance and avlablity and reduce a latency
                time for client app we use rate limiting .
                So for that we make sure that app don’t consume more resource
                than permitted.

routing 
error handling : Error handling is a process of devlopment which helps to monitor and recover the error 
                 Error handler detect each phase of error .and reporting it to user and making a
                 recovery strategy for handling Error.

Product	Where                   hosted
Apigee Edge for Public Cloud	Apigee's cloud
Apigee Edge for Private Cloud	The customer's private data center.
Apigee X	                Google Cloud
Apigee hybrid	                Both Google Cloud and the customer's private data center

We are using hybrid encryption method logic which is combination of RSA and AES algorithm which also known as strong cipher method.
symmetric AES
asymmetric Rsa
Below are the steps need to follow for encryption.

1. Generate 16 digit random number. Say RANDOMNO1.

2. Encrypt RANDOMNO1 using RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding and ICICI Public Key.

3. Encode the output of step 2 using Base64. Say ENCR_KEY.

4. Generate another 16 digit random number. Say RANDOMNO2.

5. Concatenate RANDOMNO2 and data in JSON format. Say DATA.

· DATA = RANDOMNO2 + data in JSON format

6. Perform AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding encryption on DATA using RANDOMNO1 as key and RANDOMNO2 as IV.

7. Encode the output of step 6 using Base64. Say ENCR_DATA.
